This is a personal library of functionality I use in all my projects, this library has multiple api's to allow quick and easy use of 
common functionality.

APIS:
  1. Social Network API's (Facebook, LinkedIn) Twitter and GooglePlus Coming soon.
  2. Microsoft Sql Server API
  3. Custom TCP Server & Client Package System, allows real-time functionality when installed.
  4. Helpers - Web, Networking, Social Network, Web-Request, Casting and Razor Helpers.

Facebook:
  Use the facebook api to get information from a user's profile. There is a facebook helper with authorization and other useful methods.
LinkedIn:
  Use the linkedIn api to get information from a user's profile. There is a linkedin helper with authorization and other useful methods.
Microsoft Sql Server Api:
  The Micosoft Sql Server api is used to allow easy database functionality into applications. It can create tables, databases, columns and
  add data. It can also delete databases, tables, columns and data. I'm soon going to add editing functionality.
 Custom TCP Server & Client Package System:
  The Tcp Server & Client Package System I have created allows real-time functionality when installed into an application. It can provide
  real time chats, real-time notification and it uses a packaging system which only receive and send packages installed in the system. I'm
  currently working on a security and encryption system which will be added on a later date. It can also send and recieve files, which can
  be restricted by the size specified by the developer on installation.
